The plugin uses a shortcode that you can easily insert into your posts, wherever you would like to.
A sample shortcode [bhindb category='Micro Secure Digital / Micro SD Card' description='yes' column='2' maxitem='4']
will return 4 items in 2 columns, with product decription and products should be in 'Micro Secure Digital / Micro SD Card' category.

will return 4 items in 2 columns, with product decription and products should be in 'Micro Secure Digital / Micro SD Card' category.
